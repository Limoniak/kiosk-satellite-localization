# Translate Kiosk Satellite

Translate the English text people see in Kiosk Satellite: button labels, headings, field labels, instructions and error messages. Write your translations in a file for your language under `translations/`.

For example, in this line:

```json
"commonNext": "Next"
```

**Translate `Next`. Keep `commonNext` exactly as it is.** That name lets the app find your translation.

## Start with two buttons

This example adds German translations for **Back** and **Next**. Use your own language when contributing.

1. Fork this repository so you have a copy you can edit. Read the [contributor rulebook](CONTRIBUTOR-RULES.md) and [agreement](CONTRIBUTOR-AGREEMENT.md) before submitting work.
2. Open [source/common_en.arb](../source/common_en.arb). This is your English reference. Leave it unchanged.
3. In your fork, open `translations/de/common_de.arb`. Create that folder and file if they do not exist. If the file already has translations, keep them and add or edit the relevant lines.

The English reference contains these entries among others:

```json
{
  "@@locale": "en",
  "commonBack": "Back",
  "@commonBack": {
    "context": "Common:Actions",
    "description": "Button to return to the previous step."
  },
  "commonNext": "Next",
  "@commonNext": {
    "context": "Common:Actions",
    "description": "Button to advance to the next step."
  }
}
```

For a new German file, the complete contents would be:

```json
{
  "@@locale": "de",
  "commonBack": "Zurück",
  "commonNext": "Weiter"
}
```

That translates two buttons. You do not need to finish the whole file or the whole app before opening a PR.

Notice what changed: `Back` became `Zurück` and `Next` became `Weiter`. The message names stayed the same. The `@commonBack` and `@commonNext` blocks were left out because they are instructions for you, not text shown in the app. `@@locale` identifies the language.

English and Spanish are maintained by Kiosk Satellite's author. **For Spanish, the corresponding file is [translations/es/common_es.arb](../translations/es/common_es.arb) and its language marker is `es`.** Existing translations include wording reviewed by the author. New wording may be awaiting review. The common file includes **Import**, **Back**, **Next**, **Finish**, **Working…**, **Settings**, **Cancel**, **OK**, **Grant**, **Enable**, **Refresh**, **Test**, **Install**, **Save**, **Retry**, **Copy**, **Add**, **Remove** and **Close**. It also includes time picker controls and color presets.

For Spanish, use **panel de control** for dashboard (**paneles de control** in the plural), **kiosko** for kiosk, **protector de pantalla** for screensaver, **Reproduciendo Ahora** for Now Playing and **Lanzador de Inicio** for Home Launcher.

## What to translate and what to leave alone

| What you see in the English file | What you do |
| --- | --- |
| `"commonNext": "Next"` | Copy the line into your language's file and translate only `Next`. |
| `"settingHaUrlDescription": "e.g. https://homeassistant.local:8123, without a dashboard path."` | Translate this text too. It is help shown below a field. Preserve the URL. |
| A block named `@commonNext` or any other name starting with `@` | Read it for guidance. Do not translate or copy it. |
| `context`, `description`, `x-locations`, `x-notes` or `placeholders` inside an `@` block | These explain where and how the message is used. They are not app text. |
| `@@locale` | Include it once in your translation file with your language code. |

If you are unsure about a message, leave it out and ask in your PR. Do not insert an empty value or copy English just to fill the file. Keep translations that are already present unless you intend to improve them.

## Pick the next screen

Each English file has a matching file in your language. For example:

```text
Read:  source/setup_welcome_en.arb
Edit:  translations/de/setup_welcome_de.arb
```

Only the language changes in the filename. For Spanish, that same file is `translations/es/setup_welcome_es.arb`. For Brazilian Portuguese, use `translations/pt-BR/setup_welcome_pt_BR.arb` with `"@@locale": "pt_BR"`.

Use this table to choose what to work on. The paths use the English labels visible in the app. On the device, open **Settings** first. In remote administration, choose the page from the sidebar. **Device** is under the **System** sidebar heading.

First-time setup is the wizard shown before a kiosk is configured. Its **Connect** step is separate from the **Home Assistant Setup** settings page. The reference files also contain short explanations and, for shared settings, exact device and remote administration paths in `x-locations`.

These files cover setup, Device, Home Assistant Setup, Screen & Audio, the main Screensaver controls, Clock settings and scheduled screensavers, plus Settings navigation, search and the device drawer. Screensaver media sources, pickers and slideshow settings are also included. Widgets, At a Glance and detection pages will be added in later batches. Other detailed settings pages and screens still use English where they have not been cataloged.

Dashboard names, view names, entity names and saved paths supplied by Home Assistant stay as supplied. Technical scan output also stays as supplied. Names supplied by users or plugins are not translation entries. The drawer formats plugin actions with `{pluginName}` and `{actionTitle}`. Preserve both variables. Plugin-provided wording, technical error details and published release notes remain as supplied.

## Keep variables and formatting intact

Some messages contain a value supplied by the app. For example:

```json
"setupUnexpectedResponse": "Unexpected response ({error})"
```

Translate `Unexpected response` and preserve `{error}` exactly. You may move `{error}` to fit your sentence. Do not replace it with the example `HTTP 503`. The app supplies the actual error when it displays the message.

Preserve URLs and product names such as **Kiosk Satellite** and **Home Assistant**. Keep message names unchanged. A `\n` inside text represents a line break. Keep double quotes around names and values, separate entries with commas and omit the comma after the last entry. Write a quotation mark inside a value as `\"`.

Use plain text. HTML and plural or grammatical selection expressions are not supported yet. If a message needs a grammatical variant the file cannot express, ask in an issue before translating it.

## Check font compatibility

A translation should be readable as well as correct. When a build containing your language is available, check it on the kiosk and in remote administration. If you do not have a suitable build or device, mark the PR **not yet tested** and describe what you could not check. You can submit a partial translation before testing. The maintainer coordinates the rendering review before a new language ships.

Use the actual translated screens and check:

- Characters and accents appear correctly, with no empty boxes or missing marks.
- Regional character shapes are appropriate for the language, especially Japanese, Chinese and Korean.
- Characters join and text direction behaves correctly where the language requires it.
- Body text, buttons and headings remain readable at their different weights. Check small labels and text viewed from a normal kiosk viewing distance.
- Accents, marks and lines are not clipped. Mixed text such as a translated label beside an English product name remains readable.

Check the device and remote interfaces separately because their available fonts can differ. For each problem, include the message or sample text, screen, KS version, device model and Android version. For remote administration, include the browser and operating system. Screenshots are helpful when available. Remove tokens, addresses and other private information before sharing them.

If you know a font that would solve the problem, include:

- Its family name and a link to the official project or download page.
- Its license and a link to the license text.
- The language or script it covers and the problem it addresses.
- The available weights, or the weight range for a variable font.
- The approximate size of the proposed font files, if known.

Suggest the font in the PR description or a linked issue. Do not add font files to your translation commit. You do not need to find a replacement font to report a rendering problem. The maintainer chooses and integrates approved fonts, including their notices and licenses, after checking package size, offline use and both interfaces. Third-party fonts keep their own licenses and are outside the exclusive rights granted for your translations. Home Assistant dashboard fonts are managed separately.

For a small wording correction, link to the earlier rendering review if font requirements are unchanged. Test again if the correction introduces new characters or exposes a rendering problem.

## Check and submit

If you have Python 3 installed, run this from the repository's top-level folder:

```sh
python3 tools/catalog.py validate
```

For the German example above, the result includes `de/common_de.arb: 2/43 translated`. That means two of the forty-two messages have translations. It is fine to submit that partial file.

Commit your translation files to your fork and open a PR against this repository. Fill in the PR template with your language, what you translated and your preferred public credit. Copy the `revision` value from [source/manifest.json](../source/manifest.json) into **English source revision**. Include the validation result if you ran it and complete the font compatibility section, even if your status is not yet tested.

After opening the PR, follow the [acceptance guide](PR-ACCEPTANCE.md) to check the agreement box added by the workflow. If you are unsure how to create a file or open a PR, [open an issue](https://github.com/jxlarrea/kiosk-satellite-localization/issues) with your language and the step where you got stuck.

The maintainer reviews translations and includes approved wording in a future app release. Editing a translation file does not immediately change your installed app. If English wording changes later, the affected translations need another review.
